**[Script Information]**

1. Logic is built to be performant, keep in mind that i haven't done extensive testing this since it's being rushed, i saw a couple people sell something this simple and i just wanted to go ahead and make one.
2. Completely standalone meaning no other dependencies required.
3. Synchronization between clients.
